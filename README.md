# Isostatic
Calculate different isostatic/flexure compensation depth from topography
There are three kind of isostatic compensation theory due to surface load:

1. Airy Isostasy: Topography is compensated by the variation of crust thickness with same density

2. Pratt Isostasy: Topography is compensated by the variation of crust density with uniform conpensation depth

3. Flexural Isostasy: Surface loading is compensated by the bending of lithosphere.
